I was unable to match with Amdahl's law for the diffusion1d code because the curve doesn't fit at all with the y = a/x + b type curve. I did a quick and dirty fit for diffring, and found that an approximation of the serial fraction is f = 0.09 = 9%. The diffring code performs much better than diffusion1d, at least for the params.ini that we chose. Note that we can't compare absolute times because the params.ini were different for the two, but just in terms of speedup due to adding more threads, diffring was much better.
